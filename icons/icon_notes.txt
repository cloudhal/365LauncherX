For the fasttrack images:
- Any image resizing generates artifacts, so edit the 96 image, and just change the canvas size to 50px (where they have a large border)
Then quick export as PNG
The iconsize should be about 44px, with a little spacing (3px) above and below (in case there is a shadow)
Some of the original apps don't have a border, in which case use either the 40 or 48 one, whichever is nearest to 44px. If there is a SVG use that as below.

For other images:
- Try and get the SVG, resize image to 44px using Photoshop or Photopea, then resize the canvas to 50 px to add some space
